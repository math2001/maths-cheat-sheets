# Maths Cheat Sheet

In my maths lesson, we're doing some stuff fairly boring right now. To make it a bit more enjoyable,
I decided to build little cheat sheets and to post them online.

They're designed to also save time. For example, in the data analysis section, you can paste your
data in, and all the infos about it will be displayed on the right. Explanation about *how* to get
those infos manually are displayed bellow.

So, hopefully it'll help some one, or save time. :slightly_smiling_face:
